                <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube.com</a> - Good</h3>
                <p>The website youtube.com is a video sharing site used to watch content on varius topics.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                    <li>Repetition</li>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The website youtube.com is simple. It has basic contrast of black background and white text which is easy to read. The elements are well spaced and aligned next to each other in a way that makes sense.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">art.yale.edu</a> - Bad</h3>
                <p>The Yale school of art website describes what is happening at the school of art (its various events,application,and what the school is generally about)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                    <li>Repetition</li>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Yale school of arts website does not follow any of the CRAP principles. The website is hard to read because it uses an image of a chair as its background and there are different font sizes throughout the page. The elements are not aligned properly and there is almost zero repetition.</p>
